# Demo Video Setup

To add a video background to the hero section:

1. Place your demo video file in the `public/` folder
2. Name it `demo-video.mp4`
3. The video will automatically play as a background with 20% opacity

**Recommended video specs:**
- Format: MP4
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (loops)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- File size: Keep under 5MB for fast loading

**Alternative:** If you don't have a video yet, the hero will still work with just the gradient background.
